                        <em>Educational Material Development:</em> As part of my responsibilities, I meticulously created slides and coding trivia to supplement the learning experience. These materials not only enhanced the quality of instruction but also provided students with valuable resources for self-study and revision.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        <em>Personalized Tutoring:</em> Recognizing that every student has a unique learning curve, I conducted one-on-one tutoring sessions. These sessions proved instrumental in helping individual students overcome challenges and solidify their understanding of fundamental programming concepts, which can be applied across various programming languages.
                    </p>
